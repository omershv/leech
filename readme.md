# About
This repository contains the code for LEECH (Lightweight Embedded Exploiting CHip). 
This code was used for the [Shattered Trust paper] ([bib]).
The code is designed to run on an STM32L432KC MCU connected between a Nexus 5x smartphone (i2c) and the touchscreen controller (i2c).

We never bothered cleaning up or commenting the code, I presonally think it is only useful for reference.
